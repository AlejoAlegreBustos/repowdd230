            <p class="pargf">My name is Stephen Hacking, I am an Engineering student, 
                and from the beginning of my career I tried to introduce my knowledge to the local market, 
                everything was not going very well, until I met Chamber Commerce, 
                they helped me understand the local market better,
                and so I was able to implement my industrial knowledge to the local commercial market.</p>

            <p class="pargf">
                Hello, I'm Paulo Alondra, I recently finished my secondary studies focused on marketing, 
                so I came to Chamber Commerce to get advice on careers in the field of marketing in the city's universities, among others. 
                They saw my basic knowledge in marketing and gave me 4 career plans in 4 different prestigious universities, 
                thanks to my visit to Chamber Commerce I feel more confident about my desire to study marketing at university.</p>

            <p class="pargf">Hello, my name is Lionel Meci, I am 28 years old and have not finished high school. 
                I have been looking for a job for a long time without any success,
                 a friend recommended me to come to Chamber Commerce, 
                 to guide me as to the possibilities that I have in the commercial market. 
                 When they came, they showed me the opportunities that one could have after finishing high school,
                  so it was clear to me what I had to do first. 
                  They also gave me several contacts of institutions where I can finish my secondary studies in less time.
                   At the end of my visit, I left determined to finish my studies.</p>

            <p class="pargf">Hello, my name is Monica Steffanezki, I am 65, despite being retired, 
                I became interested in learning about the new tools that exist today in the commercial market, 
                I went to Chamber Commerce to learn more about these issues. 
                I must admit that I am impressed with all the tools that exist today, such as e-commerce among others.</p>

            <p class="pargf">Hello, my name is Aylen Gonzales, and I am in my third year of high school,
                 I am in the process of choosing my major. The school that I attend made a guided tour of Chamber Commerce,
                informative talks were given, there was a lot of talk about how commerce goes beyond the purchase and sale of physical products and they showed us examples such as the new cryptocurrency trade, 
                it is really interested in this new commercial market.</p>
